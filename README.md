PSONOVA Servers and Utilities
=============================

Indirect fork of psobb-tethealla.
Mostly the same, but with some fixes here and there.

Important differences:
- runs on Linux via Wine if compiled on Windows or Mingw,
- can be built with just gcc
- DAT version not supported (MySQL only)

Installation
------------
Download the server folder and follow [these instructions](https://www.pioneer2.net/community/threads/tethealla-server-setup-instructions.1/).

If you want to build your own binaries, download the whole repo and run "make" in the top level directory, or use VS.
The binaries will automatically be copied into your local copy of the server folder.  Follow the instructions above as normal.
