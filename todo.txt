Bugs
----
- accound add bug
  ! might have something to do with gets(), cause "could not bind to port/hit enter" in login_server.c has a similar effect

- dex on HUcaseals does nothing?

- bug when shipkey.bin existts and matches login shipkey.bin but doesnt match the entry in the sql database (no entry) (login drops ship server repeatedly, as if timing out, no good error messages, no authentication error messages) (soly says check out LoginProcessPacket)

- visual bug for mob dropped items that have a grind on them showing +66, +280 etc.  visual bug disappears after theyve been picked up.

- cant open trade window
  - trade window can be prepared and sent but not received.
