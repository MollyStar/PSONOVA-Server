PSONOVA Servers and Utilities
=============================

Indirect fork of psobb-tethealla.
Mostly the same, but with some fixes here and there.

Important differences:
- runs on Linux via Wine if compiled on Windows or Mingw,
- can be built with just gcc
- DAT version not supported (MySQL only)

Installation
------------
Pre-built binaries (32-bit) are available in the bin folder.  Follow [these instructions](https://www.pioneer2.net/community/threads/tethealla-server-setup-instructions.1/) for setup.

If you want to build your own binaries, just run "make" in the src directory or use VS.
